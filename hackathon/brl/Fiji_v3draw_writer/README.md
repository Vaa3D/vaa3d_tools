This is a .v3draw writer plugin that allows ImageJ to write .v3draw files readable by [Vaa3D](http://www.vaa3d.org).
.v3draw format is a minimalist XYZCT format designed to facilitate simple and rapid file I/O in Vaa3d.

The Vaa3d_Writer project is built off of the minimal-ij-1-plugin, the code started from Albert Cardona's [great tutorials] (http://albert.rierol.net/imagej_programming_tutorials.html), utilizing previous work from Hanchuan Peng's group.  Instructions for obtaining Vaa3D source code can be found [here](https://code.google.com/p/vaa3d/wiki/BuildVaa3D)
