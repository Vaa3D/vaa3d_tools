When run ccmake, should use this folder as the source root. That is, make
a folder outside this folder, say "build", enter it, and run the command

	ccmake ../ITK-V3D-Plugins

Also we added a preference file for storing the ccmake variables such as 
ITK_DIR and V3D_BINARY_PATH, etc to the file 

	env_variable_pref.txt
ee
Then you need to copy the env_variable_pref.txt file to a *different* location
(so that you won't change this file incidentally). Now you can run cmake by
running the command

	cmake -c /path_to/env_variable_pref.txt /path_to_plugin_src

Note that "path_to_plugin_src" in this case should be "../ITK-V3D-Plugins".



If we do this, then we don't need to run manual ccmake again and again!
