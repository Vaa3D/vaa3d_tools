--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.83
June 3rd, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed compilation issue on MSVC compilers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.9.82
June 3rd, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dev: changes to the i/o module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.81
May 7th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Bug: added more prints trying to fix  the bug  "Crash when zooming-in  a huge image  after
       loading a swc file".
- Rem: temporarily disabled feature "Delete markers in a ROI". A better one is coming!
- Dev: updated namespaces in the ImageManager module.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.80
April 23rd, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added annotation toolbar. Existing annotation tools  have been moved  to the toolbar,
       that is automatically displayed on the top-left of the Vaa3D renderer. New tools are:
       - "1-right click to define a marker"  that simply  mimics the already  existing Vaa3D
          feature.
       - "1-right click to delete a marker" that delete  an already existing (and displayed)
	      marker by right-clicking on it.
	   - "1-right stroke to delete a group of markers" (experimental)
	   - "Show / hide markers around ROI" (not yet implemented)
- Fix: fixed "Vaa3D-invoked actions at the highest resolution have been temporarily removed"
       warning as this does not cause crashes anymore thanks to the recent bug fixes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.76
April 11st, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed bug that (apparently) randomly caused TeraFly  to crash throughout 3D explorat-
       ion. The bug was triggered when zooming-out from a very high resolution up to the lo-
       west one and then zooming-in in a new region.
- Fix: fixed "Fast nonuniform scaling not supported" warning when dealing with 2-slices res-
       olutions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.75
April 9st, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed minor bug which might cause dangling references to be used when exchanging data
       between the IO and the GUI thread.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.74
April 1st, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed bug in the newly added feature which caused TeraFly to crash on unix-based sys-
       tems.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.73
March 31st, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added progress bar update while 5D data are loading.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.72
March 29th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed bug which prevented the tool from importing more than 1000 time frames.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.71
March 26th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Opt: improved TeraFly's GUI appearance under Windows.
- Dev: deleted deprecated Qt-customized class "QLineTree".
- Opt: changed the name of TeraFly's control panels:
       - "Local viewer" to "Viewer"
	   - "Global coordinates" to "VOI's coordinates"
	   - "Exhaustive scan" to "Sliding viewer"
- Fix: "switch view" events are silently ignored while loading of data is in  progress. This
       makes the tool more robust to unpredictable sequences of user operations.
- Fix: user operations on 5D data are now  more robust with respect to "switch view" events. 
       A "waiting for 5D data"  state has been introduced  that ignores "switch view" events
       while 5D data are loading. Also the GUI's appearance (of both Vaa3D and TeraFly) sig-
	   gnals to the user this temporarily state through a yellow background.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.9.7
March 19th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: instant 5D data visualization. When a new time segment is loaded, the current select-
       ed frame is instantly loaded and shown while the rest of the data are loaded in back-
       ground.
- Dev: redesigned the code to deliver data from the IO thread to the GUI thread.
- Fix: fixed bug in the I/O module which caused invalid time ranges not to be detected.
- Fix: fixed improper delivering of errors from the IO thread to the GUI thread.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.63
March 18th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Opt: when the time slider is dragged  outside the displayed range,  both Vaa3D and TeraFly
       signal this to user by changing the background color to yellow.
- Dev: added "Debug" -> "Redirect stdout to file at". Depending on the verbosity level,  all
       the debug prints will be redirected to the specified file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.62
March 18th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Opt: when the  user selects  a frame through  the time  slider, the time segment loaded is
       centered on that frame. 
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused an invalid time segment selection when using the time slider
       to move along the time axis.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.61
March 16th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added  "virtual time slider"  functionality. Once  a 5D volume is opened,  the entire
       time range is accessible  through the time slider. The actual  displayed time segment
       is specified  in the "Global coordinates" panel. The dimension of  the segment can be
       modified in the "Local viewer" panel.
       @TODO: bug fixes and quicker change of the time segment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.9.6
March 15th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added "Exhaustive scan" mode. This new modality can be helpful to proofedit an entire
       volume w/o worrying that all the regions of the image  have been explored. By  simply 
       indicating the local viewer dimensions and the amount of overlap, TeraFly will parti-
       tion the volume at the current resolution into (non)overlapping blocks and will start
       a guided scan of the entire volume. To help the user in this task, a spinbox indicat-
       ing the current block number has been added. In addition, the reference system rende-
       rer also will visually highlight the block currently shown.
- New: added ROI selection feature to the reference system renderer.
- New: added mouse scrool zoom-in/out feature to the reference system renderer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.59
March 11th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed bug which caused the "Jump to resolution" functionality not to work properly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.58
March 7th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Opt: faster navigation throughout the resolutions in the case there are thousands of anno-
       tations that may slow down the graphic card as they tend to accumulate in the memory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.9.57
February 27th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Opt: improved user control of 5D functionality:
       - the number  of time  frames loaded  when the volume is opened  is controlled by the
         max dims (t) spinbox.
       - the extent of the time segment is equal to max dims (t).If max dims(t) changes, the
         next loaded time segment will take into account that.
       - substituted confunding time spinboxes  in the "Global coordinates"  panel with less
         ambiguous widgets.
       - default overlap for the time shifts is now 0%. This way, the user can quickly shift
         to the adjacent segment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.56
February 26th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed many missing "fclose" and "closedir" which may cause TeraFly not to be able to
       open a file/folder once the maximum limit (platform-dependent) has been reached.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.55
February 26th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed bug which caused error "Can't copy VOI to destination image: VOI exceeded sour-
       ce dimension along T axis".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.9.54
February 26th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed bug  which caused  "Invalid VOI selected along T"  both on 5D data and 4D data.
       This bug was not totally fixed in version 0.9.53.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.9.53
February 26th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Opt: small improvement in TeraFly's GUI when non-5D  data is imported.  In particular, the
       widgets related to 5D data are disabled.
- Fix: fixed bug which caused "Invalid VOI selected along T" error on non-5D data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.52
February 26th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Opt: improved time shift in terms of loading time and precision.
- Fix: fixed bug which caused TeraFly to crash when substituting the first view with another
       one (e.g. as a result of a directional shift along t). This bug was not totally fixed
       in version 0.9.51.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.51
February 25th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Opt: improved TeraConverter's GUI: "Time series (5D)" checkbox renamed to "Time series of"
       and moved at the top-most row.
- New: added time frame absolute coordinate in the TeraFly's GUI.
- New: added directional shift along t.
- Fix: fixed bug which caused TeraFly to crash when substituting the first view with another
       one (e.g. as a result of a directional shift along t)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.5
February 25th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added 5D feature in TeraFly. Currently, directional shifts are disabled.
- Rem: removed  permament setting  "verbosity". It  is set to the NO_DEBUG level by default. 
       The user now has to increase the verbosity level every time he needs it.
       WARNING: From now on, TeraFly is silent by default. Please increase the bverbosity le-
       vel from the TeraFly's menu "Debug" -> "Verbsosity" when needed.
- Opt: moved vmap.bin location to the root dir where all the resolutions are stored. Previo-
       usly, it was within the resolution opened by the user.
- New: added 5D volume data conversion in TeraConverter. The "time" dimension can be coupled
       with ANY of the supported formats.
- New: TeraConveter GUI redesigned so as to deal with 5D data
- New: "Max dims" spinboxes within the "Local viewer" panel are now ALWAYS enabled and their
       setting is used also to generate the volume map (before they were used only to gener-
       ate the subsequent ROIs).
- Fix: fixed compilation issue on MacOSX "undeclared identifier 'CLOCK_REALTIME'
- Fix: fixed compilation warning "WARNING: Failure to find: src/core/ImageManager/IM_defs.h"
- Fix: fixed bug which prevented "one-stroke for high-rez" function to work properly
- Fix: fixed runtime error "Zoom-in method "WYSIWYG (5 markers)" unsupported"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.41
February 16th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which might cause TeraFly to crash on Windows. 
- Dev: re-design of the i/o module. Added "TimeSeries" class (not yet finished)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.9.4
February 9th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: GUI has been re-designed from scratch for  5D image  interaction and to optimize user
       interaction. 
- Dev: added "Generate time series" entry in the "Debug" menu. On click, a 5D image  is gen-
       erated from the currently displayed image.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.32
February 1st, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: the interactive cube of the 3D reference system now has XYZ dimensions proportional to 
       the one of the currently viewed ROI.
- Fix: fixed bug which caused the "Import" dialog box to be shown when opening  volumes that
       do not exist anymore from the "Recent volumes" menu.
- New: added  "downsampling method"  combobox in TeraConverter.  Currently,  two options are
       supported: Mean (average value within 2x2x2 cube) and Max (maximum value within 2x2x2
       cube).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.31
January 29th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added syncronization TeraFly --> Vaa3D on the 3D interactive reference system
- Fix: fixed syncronization Vaa3D --> TeraFly on the 3D interactive reference system
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.3
January 26th, 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added interactive cube-based  3D reference  system in the TeraFly GUI.  Rotations are
       syncronized Vaa3D --> TeraFly. *** EXPERIMENTAL ***
	  Todo:
       - add syncronization TeraFly --> Vaa3D
	  - fix syncronization Vaa3D --> TeraFly (unique XYZ rotation needed)
- Opt: improved font size on non-Windows operative systems.
- Fix: fixed bug which might cause TeraFly to crash when rapidly clicking on the directional
       shift controls.
- New: added zoom-in method "Foreground (20 markers + mean-shift)".  This is now the default
       zoom-in method and  works as follows.  We  define  a set of N (=20) 2D  points on the
       screen  randomly  chosen within  distance d (=10% of the viewport diagonal)  from the
       center of  the viewport. For each 2D point, PPA is applied to estimate the correspon-
       ding 3D point. Then, mean-shift-based mode-seeking is applied to find the ROI center.
       
       NOTE: this method has been tested and compared  with the previously  used approaches.
             It releveals to be much more reliable specially on noisy, low-contrasted images
             and on images with little information content  (just a few objects on the back-
             ground).
- Dev: removed unused slot zoomInSensChanged().
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.9.29
October 31st, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.25
September 29th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dev: added consistency check for the volume map. Once volume map is loaded, its dimensions
       and channels are compared to those of all the loaded volumes. If no correspondence is
       found with at least one of these volumes, the consistency check fails and an error is
       displayed to the user.
- Fix: fixed wrong RAM estimation in TeraConverter.
- Fix: fixed a bug in TeraFly which caused  an  incorrect behaviour  in case of a resolution
       with just 1 slice along Z.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.24
September 28th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       buttons. Now the first event is correctly registered and the subsequent ones are ign-
       ored until the new view has been completely loaded.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.23
September 20th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dev: added more detailed printf in TeraConverter in order to solve a bug.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.9.19
September 14th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug in TeraConverter which caused resolutions with "0" pixels to be automat-
       ically selected in the GUI. This causes an error when TeraConverter tries to produce
       the mdata.bin for the "phantom" resolution after the conversion.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.18
September 13th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

September 12th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Rem: removed "Size (in memory") info box in TeraFly.
- New: added in  TeraConverter  input format "Vaa3D raw (series)" for  converting  series of
       Vaa3D raw files containing single z-planes.
- Fix: fixed a bug in TeraConverter which may cause it to crash without reporting any error
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.16
September 11th, 2013

- New: added in TeraFly info boxes "Size (in files)" and Size ("in memory").
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.15
September 10th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed bug in the TeraConverter's  "Image series (nontiled)" format  which  caused all 
       files in a folder to be loaded as images. A filter is now used to discard unsupported
       files with unsupported image extensions.
- Fix: fixed TeraConverter's file dialog issue on MacOS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.14
September 9th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Opt: tried to remove plugin dependecy from Vaa3D libraries v3dtiff and mylib,  still  need
       to be tested on other platforms.
- New: added menu "Options->3D->curves" to set 3D curves properties, such as aspect (tube or
       skeleton) and dimensions (for skeleton mode only).
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused skeleton mode not to be propagated among 3D views.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.13
September 4th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused Vaa3D's modes "1-right-stroke to define a 3D curve..." to be
       covertly propagated to other views.
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused TeraFly not to cache high res views under certain conditions
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused TeraFly to crash when zoomin-in too fast with mouse scroll.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.12
September 4th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed bug "setCurHiddenSelectedWindow"  which caused TeraFly  to incorrectly interact
       with Vaa3D when the tri-view windows were hidden. Tri-view windows now are only mini-
       mized when the corresponding 3D window is hidden.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.11
September 3rd, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added support in TeraFly for format "Vaa3D raw (tiled, 4D)".
- New: added support in TeraConverter for format "Vaa3D raw (tiled, 4D)" for storing 4D vol-
       umes with any number of channels. Each channel is stored into a separate folder cont-
       aining a two-level tiled format.
- Fix: fixed a bug  which caused  TeraFly to crash  when zooming-in  to a region outside the
       volume.
- Fix: fixed a bug which sporadically caused "Interpolation of the prebuffered image not yet 
       implemented" error. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.10
August 31th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: improved time measuring log with the addition of the following columns:
       - "Actual time": measures the actual time spent for performing time-consuming operat-
         ions  (such as volume opening, zoomin-in and traslations).
       - "Performance gain": measures  the percentage of performance gain of the actual time
         (which may include parallelized algorithms) with respect to the sum  of IO, CPU and
         GPU times.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.9
August 24th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Rem: Vaa3D-invoked actions (such as zoom-in around marker, 1-right-click, 1-right-stroke)
       triggered at the highest resolution are now ignored due to the presence of a lost bug
       which causes TeraFly to crash. A message is shown informing the user that this feature
       has been temporarily removed.
- Fix: fixed a bug which sporadically caused TeraFly to crash with the following sequence of
       actions: opening volume -> exploring -> closing volume -> opening another volume.
- Fix: fixed minor bugs (i.e. that did not cause any unexpected behaviour)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       in the file dialog for choosing the input volume.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.9.5
August 21th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Opt: faster zooming-in. While a new window is displayed with  low res data,  high res data
       are loaded in the I/O thread.
- Fix: changed output file dialog in TeraConverter from native to non-native dialog.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.9.3
August 13th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused TeraFly to crash  on MacOSX due to unsafe  GUI's update from
       the IO thread.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.2
August 12th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added support for "V3D raw (tiled)" format to both TeraConverter and TeraFly.
- New: TeraConverter's GUI redesigned so as to convert from any format A to any format B.
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused TeraConverter/TeraFly to crash when importing  tiled volumes 
       with a very high number of tiles (> 1000).  It  was found  that  directories were not
       closed and the maximum number of directories opened at the same time was reached.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.1
August 10th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: Added detailed log and time measuring panel under "Debug -> Show log".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.9.0
August 9th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: Added  pre-buffering when zooming-in using  low res data. Image  is then updated with
       high res data once it is loaded  from the disk. Support  for asynchronous  tile-based 
       loading/updating (like Google Earth) has been implemented for future developments.
- Opt: Resizing and aligning methods  don't do anything if the 3D window is  already aligned
       and correctly sized. This prevents multiple calls of these routines from slowing down
       the navigation.
- New: redesigned "About" section, with TeraFly's logo and changelog.
- New: added "Recent volumes" menu with the latest 10 volumes opened.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.8.5
May 20th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed Qt project file sources/headers inclusions to work on Windows too.
- Fix: fixed bug which caused file dialogs not to be on top of other windows on MacOS X.
- Fix: all the platform native file dialogs have been substituted with Qt dialogs because of
       a strange behaviour shown by native file dialogs on MacOS X when passing the "parent"
       argument to the static method.
- New: the following features have been re-enabled by default:
       - "Select zoom-in method" pull-down menu;
       - "Tune zoom-in threshold" slider;
       - "Double click zoom-in" feature;
       - "Foreground (1 marker)" feature;
- Fix: fixed bug which caused compilation errors on MacOS X when including Vaa3D sources.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.8.4
May 4th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: the following features have been restored under conditional  compilation (i.e. adding
       "CONFIG += use_experimental_features" to the .pro file):
       - "Select zoom-in method" pull-down menu;
       - "Tune zoom-in threshold" slider;
       - "Double click zoom-in" feature;
       - "Foreground (1 marker)" feature;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.8.3
April 30th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Rem: temporarily removed "Select zoom-in method" feature.
- Rem: temporarily removed "Double click zoom-in" feature.
- Rem: temporarily removed "Zoom-in threshold" feature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.8.2
April 29th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: new zoom-in method added! The user can now select the zoom-in method from a pull-down
       menu. Available methods are "WYSIWYG (10 markers)" and "Foreground (1 marker)".
- Opt: improved caching when  zooming-in. In particular,  the constraint on the maximum view
       dimensions is now  taken  into account when  evaluating  the intersection between the
       cached VOI and the VOI requested by Vaa3D.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.8.1
April 28th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: syncronization of "Volume" and "Others" controls during navigation.
- New: added reset button for multiresolution controls.
- New: redesigned zoom-in/out and caching controls.
- New: added "Zoom-in threshold" slider.
- Dev: overrided "setZoom" and "wheelEvent" Vaa3D methods to take full control of zoom-in.
- Dev: created "V3Dsubclasses.h/cpp" where Vaa3D subclasses are defined.
- New: "double-click zoom-in"  feature added! Double-click  with  mouse within  the renderer
       automatically  triggers  the  "right-click->Zoom-in HighRezImage: 1-right-click ROI".
       Thus, this represents a (hopefully) more usable shortcut for that feature.
- Fix: TeraConverter updated to  the last version  developed by Giulio. Still need to verify
       the bug when converting  large  V3Draw files (application crashes  when conversion is
       finished and the second resolution is imported to generate mdata.bin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.8
April 27th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: moved from "hackaton" to  "released_plugin" folder.  In this way,  the plugin will be
       automatically compiled with Vaa3D.
- Fix: fixed a bug when checking plugin version from the vmap.bin volume map binary file.
- Rem: removed realtime check of the presence of OpenCV shared library, since it not neeeded
       anymore.
- Fix: re-organization of source files and .pro file. Plugin should now be directly compati-
       ble with Windows.
- New: plugin compilation is now self-consistent, i.e. it does not depend on the compilation
       of OpenCV library anymore. This has been achievied by linking platform-dependent pre-
       compiled static OpenCV libraries.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.7.19
April 27th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       gered by Vaa3D.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7.15
April 26th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused "[...]. Check your plugin code" error when trying to zooming
       in within the highest resolution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7.14
April 25th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: Linked the mouse scroll-up zoom-in feature with data caching (still buggy).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7.11
April 24th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused "exceeded the maximum  number  of  views opened at  the same
       time" error when navigating through all the resolutions and then translating.
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused 3D windows to slowly translate  downwards  as new views were
       generated.
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused "Volume map" dialog and other dialogs to be shown behind the
       3D renderer.
- New: updated "About" section.
- Opt: eventFilter is removed from a 3D renderer when it is hidden/closed.
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused "Invalid source resolution  of coordinate mapping operation"
       error when closing volume after several zooms in/out.
- New: added gradient bar to show the current solution.
- Opt: volume compression is disabled only after 3D window is moved to minimize  the "trans-
       ient" effect.
- Opt: tri-view window is hidden as soon as possible to minimize the "transients" effect.
- Dev: added debugging message at the entry point of every function.
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused window handles to appear  in the "Window" menu of Vaa3D even
       after they were closed.
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused incorrent filtering of window close event and crash.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7.10
April 24th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused incorrect transformation of Vaa3D coordinates.
- Fix: fixed the appereance of "X","Y","Z" labels in the "Translation:"  row of the GUI. Now
       it looks the same on MacOS X too.
- Fix: fixed a bug in the "zoom-in/out" feature  which  caused 3D  image to be  cropped when
       resizing 3D window and then switching to a different resolution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.7.9
April 23th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: zoom-in history added! As it already happens with zoom-out, already  visited resolut-
       tions are maintained in memory so that when  user zooms in and the  higher resolution
       has already been visited, the corresponding view is quickly recovered and shown. This
       allows real-time zoom-in/out through  all the  resolutions,  thus  make it possible a 
       "flight" experience within the brain. 
- Fix: exceptions incorrectly catched  (message errors not shown)  in the  constructor of 3D
       navigation window.
- Fix: throwing exception (and showing an error message) when cannot write/read metadata bi-
       binary file "mdata.bin" or volume map file "vmap.bin".
- Fix: added text-align CSS property for "X","Y","Z" in the "Translate:" row.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dev: added methods to align plugin GUI both to the left or to right of the 3D renderer.
- Opt: minor changes to the layout of the GUI.
- New: added left toolbar with the same buttons/actions of the menuBar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7.7
April 22th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug in  the TeraConverter  which  caused incorrect voxel  computation for the
       lowest resolutions in the stored mdata.bin files, which  then caused incorrect behav-
       iour of TeraFly.
- New: added "Size" row in the info panel.
- New: added "Dims (mm)" row in the info panel.
- Fix: translate buttons were not disabled when zooming-out up to the lowest resolution.
- Fix: revert to 3D renderer with maximize/minimize  window buttons due  to misalignment be-
       tween 3D renderer and TeraFly plugin when using Qt::Tool flag.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7.6
April 21th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused incorrect vertical alignment between 3D renderer and TeraFly
       plugin when the first 3D view is created (this was due to a bug of Qt  when using the
       Qt::Tool flag alone to remove minimize/maximize buttons)
- New: help box added! A "what's this" message is shown for each GUI's widget when the mouse
       is over it. General instructions are provided when the mouse is outside any widget.
- Fix: 3D renderer is not hidden when hitting a point outside its window.
- New: added icons to menu entries.
- Fix: translations buttons are now disabled when the limit on the corresponding axis direc-
       tion is reached.
- Opt: the GUI has been re-designed to maximize usability. 
- Dev: QArrowButton class upgraded: 
       - arrow is now modeled by a single polygon;
       - arrow becomes brighter when mouse is over it;
       - arrow is downscaled when mouse is pressed on it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Version 0.7.5
April 20th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused application crash when performing the  following sequence of
       actions: drawing curve  -->  zoom-in --> saving ano (x2,3...).
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused application crash when performing the  following sequence of
       actions: drawing curve  -->  saving ano  -->  zoom-in  -->  zoom-out.  The reason be-
       hind the bug was an incorrect removal of duplicate annotation pointers.
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused an error message when overwriting an already  existing anno-
       tation file.
- Fix: fixed a bug  which  caused application  crash when dealing  with annotation points at 
       integer locations (e.g. 103.0000000) along any axis.
- Fix: fixed a bug which  caused  duplicate marker  annotations after modifying a marker and
       then switching to a different resolution.
- New: "Multiresolution curve annotation" added! The user can now annotate curves at any re-
       solution  and they  will be  automatically  propagated to all  the other resolutions. 
       Saving/loading annotations features too will now take into account curves.
- Fix: "File->Clear annotations" did not clear curve annotations.
- Opt: markers numeric labels are now disabled by default.
- New: annotations are stored in different files  (*.apo for cells, *.swc for  traced struc-
       tures) linked together  by  the *.ano  linker  file. In this way,  annotations can be
       loaded without loading the image by simple drag-and-drop of the .ano file in Vaa3D.
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused sporadic incorrect orientation registration between views.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7.4
April 17th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: corrected a bug  which  caused  "Invalid subvolume intervals" error  when  zooming-in
       around peripheral regions.
- Fix: when conversion in TeraConverter is finished, a  "Success" message  is  shown and the
       plugin is automatically closed.
- Fix: removed the error message that was displayed when no  file/directory  was selected in
       the TeraConverter plugin.
- Fix: tried to correct a bug which cause  the menu bar  to be automatically embedded in the
       system bar on MAC OS X. 
- Fix: corrected a bug which may cause a compilation error on some compilers.
- New: added "Traslation along an axis" feature. For each axis, 2  buttons  are displayed to
       let the user traslate the current view along that axis in the 2 possible directions.
       Currently, traslation amount is the 50% of the displayed VOI size. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7.3
April 15th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dev: added QArrowButton class to be used for traslation actions.
- New: added functionalities "Load annotations", "Save Annotations",  "Save annotations As",
       "Clear annotations". Both markers and  curves annotated  at any resolution  are saved
       (annotation of curves is not enabled at the moment) in a SWC-like format.
- New: added zoom-in/out sensitivity slider
- Fix: incorrect subolume indexes update in the "Jump to resolution" feature
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7.2
April 11th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added "Jump to resolution" feature.  User can jump to any higher resolution using the
       already existing combobox of the  "Multiresolution" form. The  volume  (or subvolume) 
	  currently displayed will be loaded at the selected resolution. A confirm dialog show-
       ing the size (in MVoxels) of the volume to load prevents from loading too big data.
- Opt: changed form title "VOI's selection from  the highest resolution volume:" to "Highest
       resolution volume's coordinates".
- Bug: all the plugin functionalities which  used pixel  coordinates in  the 3D window image
       space did not take into account  that Vaa3D downsamples the image when its  dimension
       along an axis exceeds predefined limit for that axis (LIMIT_VOLX/Y/Z = 512,512,256).
- Fix: fixed the bug which causes an error message when the "Open volume" dialog was closed.
- Opt: added a vertically stretchable space after the last component in the main GUI.
- New: added "Cancel" button and window close button in the volume import dialog.
- Fix: when a volume is closed, not all the resolutions in the combobox were removed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7.1
April 10th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: "Help->About" section added.
- Fix: close button of 3D window triggers the "File->Close volume" operation. Previusly,  it
       caused the tool to close or crash.
- Opt: volume import options have been moved to "Options->Import" menu.
- New: "File->Close volume" entry added. Now the user can  close the current  volume without
       closing the application.
- New: "File->Open volume" entry added and "Browse for dir..." button removed.
- New: top menu bar added with entries "File",  "Options" and "Help". Added  a  "File->Exit"
       entry to let the user close the application.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.7
January 30th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Rem: TeraFly feature "creating a Vaa3D marker in the image space and zooming-in"  has been 
       disabled because it conflicts with  the new "multiresolution markers annotation" fea-
       ture.
- Bug: TeraFly feature "multiresolution markers annotation" known bugs to be asap fixed:
       - markers positions precision is not  perfect in  those resolutions whose distance is
         greater than 2 factors respect to the resolution where the marker has been created;
       - markers sizes need to be manually adjusted in each view;
       - markers labels need to be manually disabled in each view.
- New: TeraFly feature "multiresolution markers annotation" (beta) added:
       - user may define markers in any view (corresponding to a certain resolution) and see
	    them also in all the other views, thus enabling markers annotation in the multires-
         olution mode;
       - user may delete markers in any view (corresponding to a certain resolution) and see
         the effect of this action in all the other views.
- Dev: added class "CAnnotations" which manages permanent multiresolution annotations.
- Dev: substitution of 'int' type with 'long long' type in some portions of code of the tool
       "TeraConverter".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.6.4
January 14th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused V3D raw file format filters in  the file dialog  not to work 
       properly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.6.3
January 10th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: in the "TeraConverter" tool, the volume is imported  after a  directory or a file has
       been choosen or a path has been inserted, instead of pushing each time on the "Start"
       button.
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused file dialogs not to be on top on MAC OS X.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.6.2
January 7th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused "OpenCV shared library not found" error message on MAC OS.
- Dev: small change in VolumeConverter.cpp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.6.1
January 7th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug which caused an error on some compilers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.6
January 6th, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: fixed a bug in "TeraConverter" which caused non-selected  resolutions to be  imported
       anyway at the end of the conversion process and then the plugin crashed.
- Fix: permanent settings in both  "TeraConverter"  and "TeraFly" tools  are saved each time 
       a single setting is changed. Previously, they were saved after the plugin was closed.
       In the case of a crash or  incorrect termination of the plugin, they  were not saved.
- New: "TeraConverter" tool added. Main features:
       - tool for the conversion of any supported format to the TeraFly format   
       - 3 different data formats supported (TeraStitcher, Image series, V3D raw) and others
         will be added in the future.
       - dynamic help text appears for every format selected.
       - progress bar with remaining time estimation
       - permanent settings (at every run it reloads the settings used the last time)
       - memory usage estimation
       - the number of resolutions is automatically detected to best fit TeraFly needs
       - the user can enable/disable individual resolutions
- Fix: bug fixed which caused old "mdata.bin" files to be not compatible.
- Fix: added check on the number of available resolutions in the multiresolution mode of the
       tool "TeraFly". The multiresolution mode seems not to properly work with one  resolu-
       tion only. At least 2 available resolutions are now needed to import a volume.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.5.3
January 2nd, 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dev: ProgressBar substituted with the newest one provided by the TeraStitcher plugin.
- Dev: plugin's name renaming: Teramanager -> TeraFly. Now "Teramanager" is the  name of the
       tools  suite  containing both the 3D visualizer  (TeraFly)  and the  volume converter
       (TeraConverter).
- Dev: added sources for volume format conversion (not used yet)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.5.2
December 31st, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: when "Re-import" checkbox is enabled, not all the available resolutions were  re-imp-
       orted with the given settings. This bug has been fixed.
- Dev: metadata version check in the metadata binary file "mdata.bin".
- Dev: plugin version check in the volume map binary file "vmap.bin".
- Dev: metadata "mdata.bin"format modified. Absolute  filepaths have been  eliminated, hence
       metadata files are now usable from any machine without re-importing the volume.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.5.1
November 26th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: color map changes are propagated when switching between different  resolutions in the
       multiresolution mode.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.5.0
November 4th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: colored images are now supported.
- Fix: image loading has been slightly optimized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.4.1
September 21st, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: The registration between consecutive resolutions did not work well when the window is
       resized. This bug has been fixed.
- New: The TeraManager window is now juxtaposed to  the navigation window and  each resizing
       or moving event on the navigation window affects also the TeraManager window.
- New: texture compression has been disabled to enhance the rendering quality.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.4
September 2nd, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: "Google Earth" feature released! The 3D exploration of the volume uses all the avail-
       able resolutions to enable a  "Google-Earth" like experience.  Transitions  to higher
       resolutions are available by:
         1) creating a Vaa3D marker in the image space and zooming-in
         2) 1-right-stroke ROI Vaa3D right-menu function
         3) 1-right-click ROI Vaa3D right-menu function
         4) VOI's precise selection (see "Precise VOI selection" feature)
       When the highest  resolution is  reached, these functions can be used to move  to an-
       other volume of interest within the same (highest) resolution.
       Volumes of interest (except for 4) have size 200x200x50 but it  can be  modified from  
       the GUI. This setting is automatically saved when the plugin is closed.
       Transitions to the higher resolution are fast (< 2 seconds on a midrange PC), whereas
       transitions  to the lower resolution are instantaneous and they  occurs when the user
       zooms out. Both transitions generate views registered each other in terms of orienta-
       tion, zoom and position of the window containing the 3D renderer.
- New: "Precise VOI selection" feature released. The user can select  a volume  of  interest 
       with 1-voxel precision using the plugin VOI spinboxes or the Vaa3D volume cut scroll-
       bars, if the "Google Earth" feature is enabled. If Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars change
       also TeraManager VOI spinboxes change and viceversa.  TeraManager  VOI spinboxes have
       values in the highest resolution volume space, while Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars have
       values in the local image space of the resolution shown in that moment. A syncroniza-
       tion mechanism takes this into account. 
       The selected VOI is always loaded from the highest resolution volume.
- New: "Resolution" GUI field which shows infos about the current active resolution.
- New: "Zoom-in VOI size" field which shows  the size (in MVoxels) of  the VOI  to be loaded
       from the higher resolution.
- New: the "Load" button of the "Precise VOI selection" feature  shows the size (in MVoxels)
       of the VOI to be loaded from the highest resolution.
- New: the plugin GUI is automatically positioned as an "extension" of the 3D renderer, when
       the "Google Earth" feature is enabled.   
- New: the VHD (Vertical, Horizontal, Depth) reference system has been changed into the same
       used by Vaa3D: XYZ (Horizontal, Vertical, Depth).

Version 0.3
August 27th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: "Google Earth" feature (preliminary version) released.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2.4
August 19th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dev: some preliminary work to enable the Google Earth feature
- New: all  application  settings are now  persistent between different runs. In particular, 
       the plugin is now able to remember the last opened volume. 
- Fix: redesigning of the import form panel of the gui (the  useless  field  displaying  the
       selected directory has been removed).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.2.3
August 18th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: added a spinbox to control the size limit for the volume map and a checkbox to regen-
       erate the volume map with the selected size limit.
- Dev: the multiresolution volume import lost in July 20th 2012 for the SVN problem has been
       reestabilished. When a volume is imported, all the other resolutions available in the
       parent folder are imported too in order to enable a "Google-Earth" feature.
- Fix: runtime detection of OpenCV library has been disabled. It didn't work  on MAC OS sys-
       tems. In order to be fixed, this should be tested on a MAC OS.

Version 0.2.2
July 24th, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix: "Select VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars" feature added (but still experimental).
       The user can select a VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars and then the selection is
       transferred to TeraManager GUI spinboxes, so the user can click on the "Load" button
       to load the selected subvolume. At this moment, the loaded subvolume is shown in the
       volume map view, but it should be shown in a new view (this bug will be soon fixed).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Version 0.2.1
July 21st, 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New: "Select VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars" feature added (but still experimental).
       The user can select a VOI with Vaa3D volume cut scrollbars and then the selection is
       transferred to TeraManager GUI spinboxes, so the user can click on the "Load" button
       to load the selected subvolume. At this moment, the loaded subvolume is shown in the
       volume map view, but it should be shown in a new view (this bug will be soon fixed).
- New: "Select ROI with Vaa3D" feature added. If the user defines a ROI with right-stroke or
       right-click from the 3D renderer right-menu, then the correspondent VOI is loaded and
       shown in a new global view.
- New: "Zoom-in" feature added. If the user defines a marker with the Vaa3D built-in feature
       (one, two or three right-click) and then zooms-in, the VOI  surrounding  the selected 
       point is loaded and displayed in the same renderer. When the user zooms-out, the ori-
       ginal map view is restored. VOI dimensions can be set from the GUI.
- New: "3D mode" added. When a volume is imported, the  plugin searches for a "good for map"
       low resolution volume  to be shown and used as a 3D map.  At this  moment, there is a
       threshold, defined by the macro TMP_VMAP_MAXSIZE, to limit the size of the volume map
       to be loaded.
